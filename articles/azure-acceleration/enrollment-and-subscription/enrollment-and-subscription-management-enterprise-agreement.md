Account/Enterprise Agreement
============================

Description
===========

> An organization's Microsoft **enterprise agreement** is the
> cornerstone of an organization\'s Azure administration and governance
> and allows for subdivisions into **Azure Departments, Azure Accounts,
> and Azure Subscriptions**. And I will add some text.
>
>  
>
> The hierarchy design is an important component in the billing
> reporting discussing in the operations section. While it is not fixed,
> it can become challenging to change the structure as workloads are
> deployed, it is important to include the appropriate stakeholders
> during the design process and run through different usage scenarios.

> To administer your Microsoft Azure services under your enrollment,
> there are **4 distinct administrative roles** and the associated
> **Azure portals**:

  **Administrative Role**        **Portal**
  ------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------
  **Enterprise Administrator**   [Enterprise Portal](https://ea.azure.com)
  **Department Administrator**   [Enterprise Portal](https://ea.azure.com)
  **Account Owner**              [Account Portal](http://account.azure.com)
  **Service Administrator**      [Management Porta](http://portal.azure.com)l

Proven Practices
================

 

> The **Enterprise Administrator** account is the first account created
> at on-boarding and has **full access and visibility into all activity
> and resources of a corporate enrollment**.
>
>  
>
> **Two people** should be assigned this responsibility resulting in the
> following benefits;
>
>  

-   **Segregation of Duties (SoD): **

    -   SoD is a basic internal control that attempts to ensure that no
        > single individual has the authority to execute two or more
        > conflicting sensitive transactions. The purpose is to prevent
        > or reduce the risk of error or changes impacting the
        > infrastructure.

-   **Staff Redundancy; **

    -   By assigning a primary and backup service continuity can be
        > ensured if the primary contract is not available.

    -   If enterprise-wide decisions need to be made the approval must
        > come from both people

-   **Prevent Collusion;**

    -   Given the appropriate assignment of the responsibility it will
        > be difficult to achieve agreement between the two to proceed
        > with an unplanned or unlawful activity.
